# Javascript for Data Scientist
Most of the time, my work start with a discussion with a client and stop when I deliver a docker image containing some machine learning models with
an API to use it. But sometimes I need to go one step further and also build a tool use it. Until now I was using some GUI framework like Qt, openCV or
pygame. But Javascript is a wonderful tool when building app. I've tested 3 frameworks : Angular, React and Vue and decided to go with Vue.
